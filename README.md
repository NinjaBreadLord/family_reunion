### About
We (Samuel, Everitt, Ritvik, and Kinish) made a website to display recipes. We have features of making recipes, seeing recipes, and filtering recipes by region. We hope this will allow people to find out about different cultures through food. There is also a map that can be used to search by region to find recipes in those regions.
